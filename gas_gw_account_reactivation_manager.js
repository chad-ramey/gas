/**
 * Script: onFormSubmit - Account Monitoring and Suspension via Google Apps Script
 * 
 * Description:
 * This Google Apps Script automates the process of monitoring and managing user account suspension and archiving in Google Workspace. 
 * It is triggered upon the submission of a Google Form, which records the details necessary for monitoring or suspending a user account 
 * (i.e., the email address of the account to be monitored, the timeframe for monitoring, the archived status, and the submitter's email address). 
 * The script checks if the submitter is authorized, updates the corresponding spreadsheet, and sends email notifications to the submitter 
 * based on the success or failure of the operation.
 *
 * Functions:
 * - `onFormSubmit(e)`: Triggered when the form is submitted. It retrieves the data from the most recent submission, checks if the submitter is authorized, 
 *   and either adds the account to a monitoring list (while tracking its archived status) or suspends the account based on the form input. 
 *   The script updates the spreadsheet with a timestamp and sends an email notification to the submitter.
 * 
 * - `calculateDeactivationDate(timeframe)`: Calculates the deactivation date based on the selected timeframe (e.g., 30 days, 60 days, indefinitely, or N/A).
 * 
 * - `addAccountToMonitor(userEmail, deactivateDate, formSubmitterEmail, wasArchived)`: Adds the specified account to a monitoring list along with its deactivation date 
 *   and tracks whether the account was archived.
 * 
 * - `removeAccountFromMonitor(userEmail)`: Removes the specified account from the monitoring list.
 * 
 * - `getArchivedStatus(userEmail)`: Retrieves the archived status of the account from the "Monitored Accounts" sheet.
 * 
 * - `monitorAccounts()`: Periodically checks the monitored accounts and suspends them if their deactivation date has been reached, notifying the submitter via email.
 * 
 * - `manageUserSuspension(userEmail, suspend, wasArchived)`: Suspends or unsuspends the specified user account. If the account was archived before being monitored, it will be 
 *   re-archived when the monitoring ends.
 * 
 * - `sendUnauthorizedEmail(yourEmail)`: Sends an email notification to users who attempt to use the form without authorization.
 * 
 * - `sendEmailNotification(yourEmail, targetEmail, success)`: Sends an email notification to the submitter, informing them of the success or failure of the monitoring/suspension operation.
 *
 * Usage:
 * 1. **Form Setup:**
 *    - The Google Form should be configured with the following fields:
 *      1. **Timestamp**: Automatically captured by Google Forms.
 *      2. **Email Address**: Automatically collected by Google Forms as the verified email address of the person submitting the form.
 *      3. **Action**: Select between "Add" (for monitoring) or "Remove" (for suspension).
 *      4. **Account Email Address**: The email address of the user account to be monitored or suspended.
 *      5. **Timeframe**: Choose "30 days," "60 days," "Indefinitely," or "N/A."
 *    - The form should be linked to a Google Sheet where submissions are recorded.
 * 
 * 2. **Trigger:**
 *  - Form Submission Trigger:
 *    - Set up the `onFormSubmit` function as an installable trigger for the Google Form submission event. This ensures the script runs each time a new form submission is recorded.
 *  - Time-Based Trigger:
 *    - Set up a time-driven trigger for the monitorAccounts function. This trigger should be configured to run periodically (e.g., daily or hourly) to check the status of monitored accounts 
 *      and suspend them if their deactivation date has been reached, while considering if the account was archived and ensuring re-archiving if necessary.
 * 
 * 3. **Permissions:**
 *    - The script restricts form access to specific email addresses. Unauthorized users will have their submissions marked as "Not Authorized" in the "Completed" column and will receive 
 *      an email notification.
 * 
 * 4. **Script Execution:**
 *    - Upon form submission, the script will:
 *      1. Retrieve the most recent form submission data.
 *      2. Verify the submitterâ€™s authorization.
 *      3. If the user is not authorized, mark the submission as "Not Authorized" and send an email notification.
 *      4. If authorized, the script will either add the account to the monitoring list (tracking whether the account was archived) or suspend the account based on the form input.
 *      5. Update the corresponding row in the linked Google Sheet with a timestamp if the operation is successful.
 *      6. Send an email notification to the submitter, indicating whether the operation was successful or if there was an issue.
 * 
 * Notes:
 * - The "Monitored Accounts" sheet includes the following columns:
 *   - **Column A**: `Monitored Accounts` - Holds the email addresses of the accounts being monitored.
 *   - **Column B**: `Deactivation Date` - Stores the deactivation date or "Indefinitely" for accounts monitored without a set timeframe.
 *   - **Column C**: `Form Submitter Email` - Records the email address of the person who submitted the form.
 *   - **Column D**: `Archived Y/N` - Indicates whether the account was archived when it was added to the monitoring list.
 * - The script includes functionality to remove accounts from the monitoring list after the specified timeframe, suspend them, and re-archive them if they were archived before.
 * - Ensure the necessary permissions and APIs (like the Admin SDK) are enabled for the service account used by the script.
 * - The script logs success or failure messages for the operations, which can be reviewed in the Script Editor's Logs.
 * - In case of an error during the process, the script sends a failure notification with instructions to contact the administrator.
 * 
 * Action Items:
 * - Archived accounts tracked for re-archiving.
 * - Move to Deactivated OU.
