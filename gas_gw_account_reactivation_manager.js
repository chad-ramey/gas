/**
 * Script: onFormSubmit - Account Monitoring and Suspension via Google Apps Script
 * 
 * Description:
 * This Google Apps Script automates the process of monitoring and managing user account suspension in Google Workspace. 
 * It is triggered upon the submission of a Google Form, which records the details necessary for monitoring or suspending a user account 
 * (i.e., the email address of the account to be monitored, the timeframe for monitoring, and the submitter's email address). 
 * The script checks if the submitter is authorized, updates the corresponding spreadsheet, and sends email notifications to the submitter 
 * based on the success or failure of the operation.
 *
 * Functions:
 * - `onFormSubmit(e)`: Triggered when the form is submitted. It retrieves the data from the most recent submission, checks if the submitter is authorized, 
 *   and either adds the account to a monitoring list or suspends the account based on the form input. The script updates the spreadsheet with a timestamp and 
 *   sends an email notification to the submitter.
 * 
 * - `calculateDeactivationDate(timeframe)`: Calculates the deactivation date based on the selected timeframe (e.g., 30 days, 60 days, indefinitely, or N/A).
 * 
 * - `addAccountToMonitor(userEmail, deactivateDate, formSubmitterEmail)`: Adds the specified account to a monitoring list along with its deactivation date.
 * 
 * - `removeAccountFromMonitor(userEmail)`: Removes the specified account from the monitoring list.
 * 
 * - `monitorAccounts()`: Periodically checks the monitored accounts and suspends them if their deactivation date has been reached, notifying the submitter via email.
 * 
 * - `manageUserSuspension(userEmail, suspend)`: Suspends or unsuspends the specified user account.
 * 
 * - `sendUnauthorizedEmail(yourEmail)`: Sends an email notification to users who attempt to use the form without authorization.
 * 
 * - `sendEmailNotification(yourEmail, targetEmail, success)`: Sends an email notification to the submitter, informing them of the success or failure of the monitoring/suspension operation.
 *
 * Usage:
 * 1. **Form Setup:**
 *    - The Google Form should be configured with the following fields:
 *      1. **Timestamp**: Automatically captured by Google Forms.
 *      2. **Email Address**: Automatically collected by Google Forms as the verified email address of the person submitting the form.
 *      3. **Action**: Select between "Add" (for monitoring) or "Remove" (for suspension).
 *      4. **Account Email Address**: The email address of the user account to be monitored or suspended.
 *      5. **Timeframe**: Choose "30 days," "60 days," "Indefinitely," or "N/A."
 *    - The form should be linked to a Google Sheet where submissions are recorded.
 * 
 * 2. **Trigger:**
 *    - Form Submission Trigger:
 *      - Set up the `onFormSubmit` function as an installable trigger for the Google Form submission event. This ensures the script runs each time a new form submission is recorded.
 *    - Time-Based Trigger:
 *      - Set up a time-driven trigger for the monitorAccounts function. This trigger should be configured to run periodically (e.g., daily or hourly) to check the status of monitored accounts and suspend them if their deactivation date has been reached.
 * 
 * 3. **Permissions:**
 *    - The script restricts form access to specific email addresses. Unauthorized users will have their submissions marked as "Not Authorized" in the "Completed" column and will receive an email notification.
 * 
 * 4. **Script Execution:**
 *    - Upon form submission, the script will:
 *      1. Retrieve the most recent form submission data.
 *      2. Verify the submitterâ€™s authorization.
 *      3. If the user is not authorized, mark the submission as "Not Authorized" and send an email notification.
 *      4. If authorized, the script will either add the account to the monitoring list or suspend the account based on the form input.
 *      5. Update the corresponding row in the linked Google Sheet with a timestamp if the operation is successful.
 *      6. Send an email notification to the submitter, indicating whether the operation was successful or if there was an issue.
 * 
 * Notes:
 * - The "Monitored Accounts" sheet includes the following columns:
 *   - **Column A**: `Monitored Accounts` - Holds the email addresses of the accounts being monitored.
 *   - **Column B**: `Deactivation Date` - Stores the deactivation date or "Indefinitely" for accounts monitored without a set timeframe.
 *   - **Column C**: `Form Submitter Email` - Records the email address of the person who submitted the form.
 * - The script includes functionality to remove accounts from the monitoring list after the specified timeframe and to notify the submitter when the account is suspended.
 * - Ensure the necessary permissions and APIs (like the Admin SDK) are enabled for the service account used by the script.
 * - The script logs success or failure messages for the operations, which can be reviewed in the Script Editor's Logs.
 * - In case of an error during the process, the script sends a failure notification with instructions to contact the administrator.
 * 
 * Action Items:
 * - Test
 * - Move to Deactivated OU
